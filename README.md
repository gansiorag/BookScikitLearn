# Book machine learning library
Here are my descriptions of the libraries that I use for solving machine learning problems.<br>

It also contains the necessary information to understand some of the terms used in machine learning. <br>
I describe the terms in the form of a cheat sheet, with code examples when necessary.<br>

  This is a great YouTube series of short videos explaining neural networks, forward propagation gradient descent, and more. It is an amazing introduction video or refresher about neural networks!
Amazing animations, super clear, code, math, everything you need to be entertained and learn in less than 5 minutes per video!
